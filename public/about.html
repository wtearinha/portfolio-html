  passion towards web development during one of my classes, which is what i want to study deeply. I enjoy computer since i'm really younger,

  my abilities in webdev and get a job in the field, i want to make better and more projects so i can use the skills i'm getting and apply them into 
  some real projects and real works for people and mayhaps a company, i'm looking forward into learning.</p>
